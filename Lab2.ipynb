    "# Lab 2: Understanding dynamics in complex systems\n",

    "Last week we looked at models of networks, and explored some of the metrics and visualisation techniques we could use to analyse these networks.  This week we turn our attention more specifically to dynamics.  We will use ordinary differential equations to model time dependent complex systems and use some elements of bifurcation analysis to understand the outputs of these models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, let's look at a classic model that underpins complex systems models in a range of applications, from brain dynamics to opinion dynamics: the Kuramoto model.  The Kuramoto model is a 'minimal model' describing oscillator dynamics, and the emergence of oscillator synchronisation.  At its simplest it is an all-to-all network of $N$ oscillators, with each oscillator having its own intrinsic frequency $\\omega_i$, and inter-oscillator coupling strength $K$:\n",

    "\n",
    "There is an enormous amount of work that has been done on this system of equations, and high impact papers are continuing to be published on extensions to the base model.
